## 👾 About Me
I'm a student who enjoys exploring Windows development and security.  
Most of my learning comes from following how a program actually flows:

how memory is structured, how the Win32 API connects across layers,  
and how complex behavior becomes clearer when viewed as a continuous process.  
I'm slowly organizing what I understand, one concept at a time.
